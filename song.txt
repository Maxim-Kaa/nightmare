Thriller
It's close to midnight 
and something evil's lurkin' in the dark.
Under the moonlight, 
you see a sight that almost stops your heart.
You try to scream, 
but terror takes the sound before you make it.
You start to freeze 
as horror looks you right between the eyes.
You're paralyzed.
 
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.
And no one's gonna save you 
from the beast about to strike.
You know it's thriller, thriller night.
You're fighting for your life 
inside a killer thriller tonight.
