Thriller
It's close to midnight 
and something evil's lurkin' in the dark.
Under the moonlight, 
you see a sight that almost stops your heart.
You try to scream, 
but terror takes the sound before you make it.
You start to freeze 
as horror looks you right between the eyes.
You're paralyzed.
 
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.
And no one's gonna save you 
from the beast about to strike.
You know it's thriller, thriller night.
You're fighting for your life 
inside a killer thriller tonight.

ou hear the door slam 
and realize there's nowhere left to run.
You feel the cold hand 
and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
You close your eyes and hope 
that this is just imagination, girl.
But all the while, 
you hear a creature creepin' up behind.
You're out of time.
 
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.
Yeah, there ain't no second chance
against the thing with forty eyes, girl.
Thriller, thriller night.
You're fighting for your life
inside a killer thriller tonight.
 
Night creatures callin', 
the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
There's no escaping 
the jaws of the alien this time.
(They're open wide).
This is the end of your life, ooh.
 
They're out to get you,
there's demons closin' in on every side.
They will possess you
unless you change that number on your dial.
Now is the time 
for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah.
All through the night,
I'll save you from the terror on the screen.
I'll make you see...
 
...that this is thriller, thriller night.
'Cause I can thrill you more than
any ghost would ever dare try.
Thriller, thriller night.
So let me hold you tight and share a
killer, killer, chiller thriller here tonight.
 
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.
Girl, I can thrill you more
than any ghost would ever dare try.
Thriller, thriller night.
So let me hold you tight
and share a killer thriller, ow!
 
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight).
 
Darkness falls across the land.
The midnight hour is close at hand.
Creatures crawl in search of blood
to terrorize y'alls neighborhood.
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight).
And whosoever shall be found
without the soul for getting down
must stand and face the hounds of hell
and rot inside a corpse's shell.
 
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight).
(Thriller)
Ooh...
(Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight.
(Thriller)
Oh, darlin'.
(Oh, baby).
 
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller)
Ooh, babe.
(Thriller night, babe).
I'm gonna thrill you tonight.
(Thriller)
Oh, darlin'.
(Oh, baby).
Thriller night, baby.
(Thriller night, baby).
Ooh!
 
The foulest stench is in the air,
the funk of forty thousand years.
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
are closing in to seal your doom.
 
And though you fight to stay alive,
your body starts to shiver,
for no mere mortal can resist
the evil of the thriller.

Michael Jackson
